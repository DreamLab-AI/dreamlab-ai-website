## AI Agents & Technology

### What is an AI agent in plain English?

A repeatable workflow that:
1. Uses AI to do a task
2. Takes inputs (data, files, requests)
3. Uses tools (software, APIs, connections)
4. Produces outputs you can check and verify
5. Can be improved over time based on results

Examples:
- Read support tickets → Categorize → Draft replies
- Get new sales leads → Research company → Draft follow-up
- Extract data from documents → Populate systems → Flag issues

### Is this just advanced prompting?

No. Prompting matters, but that's only one part:
- Prompts define what the agent does
- Workflow defines how it's structured
- Tools define what data it can access
- Testing ensures it works reliably
- Monitoring shows when it breaks

Real value is building workflows you can run again and improve.

### Will agents be fully autonomous?

Sometimes. Often the smart approach is:
- **Agent does the work** (analyze, research, draft)
- **Human approves** before action is taken
- **Agent executes** with human oversight

This is safer and more reliable than fully autonomous systems.

### Can we connect agents to our existing tools?

Yes! As long as you can access them in a practical way:
- APIs (direct integrations)
- Exports/imports (CSV, JSON files)
- Shared folders (Google Drive, OneDrive)
- Email (parse and send)
- Webhooks (event-triggered connections)

We aim to connect to one real data source on day one of training.

## Consulting & Implementation

### What does consulting involve?

Custom work tailored to your organization:
- **Discovery:** Understanding your needs and workflows
- **Design:** Planning the AI system architecture
- **Implementation:** Building agents and integrations
- **Testing:** Validating before deployment
- **Deployment:** Running in production
- **Training:** Teaching your team to maintain it

### How long does a consulting engagement last?

Varies based on scope:
- **Short projects:** 1-2 weeks
- **Medium projects:** 1-3 months
- **Long-term:** Ongoing support and optimization

We discuss timelines during the discovery phase.

### Can we combine consulting with training?

Yes! Common approach:
- Your team takes workshops to learn fundamentals
- We do consulting work on your specific use cases
- Your team gradually takes over maintenance
- Cost-effective transfer of knowledge

### How much does consulting cost?

Pricing depends on scope, duration, and complexity. We provide quotes after discussing your specific needs. Contact us for a consultation.

## Technical Questions

### What AI models do you use?

We teach working with multiple models:
- **OpenAI:** GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5
- **Anthropic:** Claude (various versions)
- **Open source:** Llama, Mistral, and others
- **Local models:** Running AI on your own hardware

We focus on model-agnostic approaches so your agents work with any model.

### Do I need an API key?

For most training, yes. You'll need:
- OpenAI API key (free trial available)
- Or access to another LLM provider
- You control costs (we show budget-conscious approaches)
- Not required for theory sessions

We show cost-effective ways to use APIs.

### What programming languages do you use?

Primarily:
- **Python** - Most AI agent frameworks
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Web-based agents
- **Rust/Go** - Production systems

We focus on the concepts, not just syntax. If you know one language, you can learn another.

### Do we need to install software?

For workshops, yes:
- Code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
- Python and/or Node.js
- Git version control
- API keys for your chosen AI provider

We provide **setup guides before your workshop** with step-by-step instructions.
