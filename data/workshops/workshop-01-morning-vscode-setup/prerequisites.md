## FAQ: Prerequisites

### "I've never coded before. Is this for me?"
**Absolutely!** This workshop is designed for non-programmers. We use VS Code as a document editor, not a coding tool.

### "Do I need to pay for AI services?"
**No.** Free tiers are available for all AI providers we use. You can complete the entire workshop without spending money.

### "What if my computer is old?"
**Try it!** If your computer can run a web browser, it can likely run VS Code. Performance may vary, but core features work on older hardware.

### "Can I use a tablet or Chromebook?"
**Limited.** VS Code has a web version, but the full desktop experience is recommended for this workshop.

### "What if I can't install software?"
**Contact us.** We may have alternative approaches or can help you request IT permissions.

### "Do I need to finish in one sitting?"
**No.** Content is modular. Take breaks, return later. Your progress saves automatically.
