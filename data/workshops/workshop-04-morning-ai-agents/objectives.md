# Learning Objectives - AI Agents Workshop

## By the end of this session, you will be able to:

### Knowledge
- [ ] **Explain agent architectures**: ReAct, Plan-and-Execute, Reflection patterns
- [ ] **Compare agent frameworks**: Claude SDK, OpenAI Assistants, LangChain, AutoGen
- [ ] **Understand tool use**: Function calling, MCP servers, sandboxed execution
- [ ] **Identify agent design patterns**: Single-agent, multi-agent, hierarchical systems
- [ ] **Recognize safety considerations**: Sandboxing, rate limits, cost controls

### Skills
- [ ] **Build single-agent systems** with Claude Agent SDK or OpenAI Assistants
- [ ] **Implement tool use** including web search, code execution, file operations
- [ ] **Create custom tools** using function definitions and MCP protocol
- [ ] **Debug agent behavior** using traces, logs, and reasoning chains
- [ ] **Handle errors gracefully** with retries, fallbacks, and validation

### Application
- [ ] **Design autonomous workflows** for research, coding, or data analysis
- [ ] **Integrate agents** into existing applications and APIs
- [ ] **Optimize performance** balancing speed, cost, and accuracy
- [ ] **Deploy production agents** with monitoring and safety controls
- [ ] **Evaluate agent quality** using test cases and benchmarks

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Build 3+ working agent examples (research, code, data)
- ✅ Implement custom tool with proper error handling
- ✅ Create multi-step agent workflow (5+ operations)
- ✅ Pass assessment with 80% or higher
- ✅ Complete capstone project with production patterns
