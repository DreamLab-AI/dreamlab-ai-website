# Chapter 6: Navigating Challenges and Considerations

While OpenAI Codex offers transformative potential, it is essential to approach its use with an awareness of its current limitations and the broader implications surrounding security, ethics, and legality. Acknowledging these factors is crucial for responsible and effective integration into development workflows.

The workshop touched upon the iterative nature of developing such powerful tools and the ongoing learning process:
> "it's tough like I I definitely have advocated for like little garwells here and there until like the next training run's done uh but um I I think that's really like we're really building for this future where the model is able to make all these decisions" - Josh, OpenAI

This chapter will cover:

*   [Limitations of Codex](./06_a_limitations_of_codex.md): Understanding what Codex can't do (yet), including context window constraints, handling complex domain-specific logic, and potential for inaccuracies.
*   [Security Implications](./06_b_security_implications.md): Discussing the benefits of sandboxing, risks of AI-generated vulnerabilities, and secure use practices.
*   [Ethical and Legal Considerations](./06_c_ethical_and_legal_considerations.md): Exploring issues of copyright, intellectual property, bias in AI code generation, and the evolving role of developers.

A "trust but verify" approach is essential when working with AI-generated code, and this chapter aims to equip you with the awareness needed for that verification.
