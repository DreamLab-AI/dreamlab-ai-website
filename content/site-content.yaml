    section_label: "A Story of Transformation"
    section_title: "When the Technology Finally Made Sense"
    narrative:
      opening: "Sarah arrived with 15 years in post-production but had never touched an LED volume. She'd watched the industry shift beneath her feet, seen junior artists land jobs she couldn't even apply for because \"virtual production experience required\" had become the gatekeeping phrase of the decade. The drive up to the Lake District felt like admitting defeat."
      journey: "The first two days were humbling. Unreal Engine's node graphs looked like conspiracy theory boards. The camera tracking system spoke a language that made her decades of After Effects mastery feel suddenly irrelevant. She stayed up late in the converted barn studio, rain drumming on the slate roof, trying to make a virtual sunset behave the way sunsets actually behave."
      pull_quote:
        text: "On day three, standing in front of that virtual sunset that finally responded to my camera moves in real-time, I understood why my traditional compositing workflow suddenly felt like archaeology."
        attribution: "Sarah M., Senior Colourist turned VP Supervisor"
      shift: "The breakthrough came not in a classroom but during a morning walk along Derwentwater. Something about watching fog lift off the water while mentally replaying the volumetric lighting tutorial from the night before. The real and the virtual stopped feeling like opposing forces. By the final session, she wasn't just operating the LED wall—she was choreographing light the way she'd always wanted to, just with tools that hadn't existed when she started her career."
      result: "Six months later, Sarah leads virtual production integration at a mid-sized commercial house in Manchester. Her first VP job was a car commercial where the \"location\" was generated entirely from HDRI data she captured in the Lake District on that last morning—the same mountains she'd walked past, now wrapped around an LED volume, responding to camera moves she was calling."
