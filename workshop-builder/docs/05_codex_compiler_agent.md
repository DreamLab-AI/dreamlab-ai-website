    A[Orchestrator] -- Topic, ResearchDataPaths --> B(CompilerAgent);
    B -- Reads --> C[workshop_compiler_agent_prompt.md];
    B -- Prepares Input for AI --> D{Codex AI Model (CLI/API)};
    C --> D;
    E[Research Data Files] -.-> D;

```

1.  **Input to `CompilerAgent`:**
    *   `topic`: The main subject of the workshop.
    *   `unstructured_data_paths`: A list of file paths pointing to the temporary files containing raw research data (from `ResearchAgent`).
2.  **Prompt Loading:** The `CompilerAgent` loads the master instructional prompt from [`workshop_compiler_agent_prompt.md`](../workshop_compiler_agent_prompt.md).
3.  **AI Model Invocation:**
    *   The `CompilerAgent` prepares the input for the "Codex" AI model. This involves:
        *   Injecting the `topic` and references to `unstructured_data_paths` (or their content, if feasible) into placeholders within the master prompt.
        *   Specifying the output directory where the AI should generate the markdown files (this is the newly created `workshop-XX-slug/` directory).
    *   The "Codex" AI model processes this combined input.
4.  **Content Generation by AI:** The "Codex" AI model, guided by the prompt, analyzes the research data and writes the individual workshop section files (`00_*.md`, `01_*.md`, etc.) directly into the specified output directory.
5.  **Templating by `CompilerAgent`:** After the AI model has generated the core content files, the `CompilerAgent`:
    *   Scans the generated `.md` files in the module directory.
    *   Uses this list, along with the topic and workshop number, as context for rendering `manifest.json` and `README.md` from their respective Jinja2 templates.
6.  **Output from `CompilerAgent`:** The absolute path to the newly created and fully populated workshop module directory.

### User/Developer Interaction Points:

*   **Primary User Interaction:** Indirect. Users specify the `--topic` to `cli.py`. The `Orchestrator` then automatically invokes the `CompilerAgent`.
*   **Developer Interaction (Configuration & Prompts):**
    *   **API Keys:** Developers must configure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or equivalent for other models) in the `.env` file.
    *   **Master Prompt:** The primary point of control for the "Codex" AI's behavior is the [`workshop_compiler_agent_prompt.md`](../workshop_compiler_agent_prompt.md). Developers can modify this prompt to change how workshops are structured, the style of content, or the specific instructions given to the AI.
    *   **Jinja2 Templates:** Developers can modify [`templates/workshop_manifest.json.j2`](../templates/workshop_manifest.json.j2) and [`templates/README.md.j2`](../templates/README.md.j2) to change the format of these supporting files.
    *   **Agent Logic:** Developers can modify the Python code within `CompilerAgent` to change how it interacts with the AI model (e.g., switch between CLI/API, alter pre/post-processing steps).

## c. Known Limitations, Best Practices, and Ethical Considerations

### Known Limitations:

1.  **Context Window:** LLMs have a finite context window. If the combined size of the master prompt and the content of all research data files is too large, the AI's performance may degrade, or it might miss information. Strategies like summarizing research data or processing it in chunks might be needed for very large inputs (not currently implemented in the placeholder).
2.  **Accuracy & Hallucinations:** The AI model might occasionally generate inaccurate information or "hallucinate" details not present in the source data. **Human review of all generated content is essential.**
3.  **Consistency:** While the prompt aims for consistency, there can be variations in style or depth across different sections generated by the AI.
4.  **Nuance and Domain Expertise:** For highly specialized or nuanced topics, the AI might not capture the full depth or subtlety that a human expert would. The quality of output is heavily dependent on the quality and comprehensiveness of the input research data.
5.  **Formatting Quirks:** The AI might sometimes produce minor markdown formatting inconsistencies that require manual touch-up.
6.  **Understanding of "Files":** Instructing an LLM to "read these files" and "write to this directory structure" is an abstraction. The actual implementation (CLI passthrough, API function calling, or custom data chunking) needs to robustly manage these interactions. The current `workshop_compiler_agent_prompt.md` assumes the AI can understand these instructions conceptually.

### Best Practices for Usage:

1.  **High-Quality Research Data:** The better the input data from `ResearchAgent`, the better the `CompilerAgent`'s output. Ensure research data is relevant, comprehensive, and reasonably clean.
2.  **Iterative Prompt Engineering:** The [`workshop_compiler_agent_prompt.md`](../workshop_compiler_agent_prompt.md) is critical. Expect to iterate on this prompt to fine-tune the AI's output structure, style, and depth.
3.  **Clear Topic Scoping:** Provide clear and well-defined topics to the CLI to help the AI focus its generation efforts.
4.  **Human Review and Editing:** **Always treat AI-generated content as a first draft.** Human subject matter experts must review, edit, and validate all workshop materials for accuracy, completeness, clarity, and pedagogical soundness before use.
5.  **Start Small:** When modifying prompts or testing, start with smaller topics or a subset of research data to iterate faster.
6.  **Monitor API Usage & Costs:** If using paid APIs, monitor token consumption and associated costs.
7.  **Version Control Prompts & Templates:** Treat `workshop_compiler_agent_prompt.md` and Jinja2 templates as critical code artifacts and keep them under version control.

### Ethical Considerations & Specific Usage Guidelines:

1.  **Transparency:**
    *   **Guideline:** If workshops generated by this tool are published, it's advisable to indicate that AI assistance was used in their creation, maintaining transparency with end-users/learners.
    *   **Consideration:** The level of disclosure may vary depending on the extent of human review and modification.
2.  **Authorship and Intellectual Property:**
    *   **Guideline:** Understand the terms of service of the AI model provider regarding ownership of generated content.
    *   **Consideration:** The legal status of AI-generated content can be complex and varies by jurisdiction. The organization using Workshop Builder is responsible for ensuring compliance with IP laws. Content derived from research data must respect the copyright of that source data.
3.  **Bias Mitigation:**
    *   **Guideline:** Be aware that AI models can reflect biases present in their training data. Review generated content for any signs of demographic, cultural, or technical bias.
    *   **Consideration:** If the research data itself contains biases, the AI is likely to reproduce them. Strive for diverse and balanced research inputs.
4.  **Accuracy and Reliability (Safety):**
    *   **Guideline:** **Never deploy or use safety-critical information or instructions generated solely by the AI without rigorous expert verification.** This is especially true for workshops on topics with potential real-world consequences (e.g., medical, financial, engineering).
    *   **Consideration:** The Workshop Builder is a tool to assist, not replace, human expertise and responsibility.
5.  **Over-Reliance:**
    *   **Guideline:** Encourage users (educators, developers) to use the tool as a productivity aid, not a crutch. Critical thinking and subject matter expertise remain paramount.
    *   **Consideration:** Avoid situations where the AI is trusted blindly, especially in rapidly evolving fields where its training data might be outdated.
6.  **Data Privacy (Research Data):**
    *   **Guideline:** If the `ResearchAgent` gathers data from private or sensitive sources (not its current design, which implies public/general knowledge), ensure that passing this data to the "Codex" AI model complies with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and the AI provider's data usage policies.
    *   **Consideration:** The current design focuses on user-provided topics, implying the research phase targets generally accessible information.
7.  **Environmental Impact:**
    *   **Consideration:** Training and running large AI models consume significant energy. While Workshop Builder itself is an application layer, be mindful of the broader environmental impact of the underlying AI services used. This is more of a general AI consideration than specific to this tool's usage guidelines.

By adhering to these best practices and ethical considerations, the "Codex" component within Workshop Builder can be a powerful and responsible tool for accelerating the creation of valuable educational content.
