> **💡 Tip:** Start with GitHub Copilot if you're a student (it's free!), or use Continue with free API tiers from Anthropic, Google, or OpenAI.

## Pro Tips for Success

> **🎯 Start Simple:** Master basic Git workflows before diving into AI-assisted development.

> **💡 Commit Often:** Small, frequent commits are your time machine—make liberal use of them.

> **🤖 Learn AI Limitations:** AI assistants are powerful but not infallible. Always review generated code.

> **🔐 Security First:** Never commit API keys or secrets. Use environment variables and `.gitignore`.

> **📚 Read the Docs:** Official documentation is always more reliable than AI-generated answers for edge cases.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

```
❌ AVOID                          ✅ DO INSTEAD
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Committing without messages    →  Write descriptive commit messages
Ignoring .gitignore             →  Exclude node_modules, .env files
Pushing directly to main        →  Use feature branches & PRs
Trusting AI blindly             →  Review and test all generated code
Working without backups         →  Push to GitHub regularly
Hardcoding secrets              →  Use environment variables
Large binary files in Git       →  Use Git LFS or external storage
```

## Looking Ahead: The Future of Development in 2025

As we progress through 2025, several trends are reshaping development:

**🤖 Agentic AI**: Tools like Claude Code that can autonomously complete complex tasks with MCP servers

**🔗 Integrated Workflows**: Seamless connections between version control, CI/CD, and deployment

**☁️ Cloud-Native Development**: Editing, testing, and deploying entirely in the cloud (GitHub Codespaces)

**🧠 Context-Aware AI**: Assistants that understand your entire codebase and development history

This workshop positions you at the forefront of these changes.

> **📝 Note:** The field is evolving rapidly. What's cutting-edge today may be standard tomorrow. Focus on fundamentals that transfer across tools.
