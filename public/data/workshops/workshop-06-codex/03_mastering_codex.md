# Chapter 3: Mastering Codex: From Basic Prompts to Advanced Workflows

Effectively utilising OpenAI Codex involves more than just providing simple commands; it requires understanding how to communicate intentions clearly, guide the AI's behaviour, and manage tasks efficiently. This chapter delves into strategies for crafting effective prompts, leveraging `AGENTS.MD` files, managing workflows, and employing advanced techniques to transition from basic use to true mastery.

As the workshop discussion highlighted, interacting with these advanced AI agents is a new skill:
> "it takes a leap of faith the first two times you're like I'm not really sure if this is going to work and it goes off for like 30 minutes right but then you he comes back and it's like wow this this this agent went out wrote a bunch of code wrote scripts to help code mod its own changes right tested this and it really went through the full end to end of thinking about the change it wants to make" - Josh, OpenAI

This chapter will cover:

*   [Effective Prompting Strategies](./03_a_effective_prompting_strategies.md): Learn how clarity, context, and iteration can significantly improve Codex's output.
*   [The Crucial Role of AGENTS.MD](./03_b_the_crucial_role_of_agents_md.md): Understand how to use these files to provide persistent, repository-specific instructions to Codex.
*   [Managing Tasks Efficiently](./03_c_managing_tasks_efficiently.md): Explore techniques for breaking down work, parallel execution, reviewing results, and using CLI approval modes.
*   [Advanced Techniques](./03_d_advanced_techniques.md): Discover CLI automation, recipes, model selection, multimodal input, and the concept of fine-tuning.

Mastering these aspects will transform your interaction with Codex from a simple command-response exchange into a more nuanced and powerful collaboration.
