# Chapter 5: The Broader Landscape: Codex, GPT Models, and the Future of AI in Coding

OpenAI Codex, in its various forms, does not exist in isolation. It is part of a larger ecosystem of AI models and tools developed by OpenAI and others, all contributing to the evolving role of AI in software development. Understanding how Codex relates to general-purpose GPT models and the direction of OpenAI's agent-building technologies provides crucial context for advanced users.

The workshop discussions touched upon this broader context, particularly how learnings from specialised models like Codex feed into general model improvements:
> "we're going to generalize the learnings from that model into like an even bigger model that's like getting all these other like learnings from other functional purposes and like these together will like become a really powerful thing and that's like kind of like the philosophy we've have with training models so far" - Alexander, OpenAI

This chapter will explore:

*   [Codex vs. General GPT Models](./05_a_codex_vs_general_gpt_models.md): Comparing the operational paradigms and strengths of specialised Codex tools versus general GPT models (like GPT-4 via API) for coding tasks.
*   [Understanding Model Choices](./05_b_understanding_model_choices.md): Delving into specific models like `codex-1`, `codex-mini-latest`, `o4-mini`, and other GPT variants, and their implications for performance and cost.
*   [The Evolving Toolkit: New OpenAI APIs and Agentic Capabilities](./05_c_the_evolving_toolkit.md): A brief overview of new APIs (like the Responses API) and built-in tools (Web Search, File Search, Computer Use) that signal future directions for AI agents.

This broader perspective helps in making informed decisions about which tools and models to use for different scenarios and in anticipating future advancements in AI-assisted software engineering.
