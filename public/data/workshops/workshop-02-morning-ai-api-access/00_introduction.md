```

## Why Direct API Access Changes Everything

### The Hidden Truth About AI Costs

**Consumer Subscriptions:**
- ChatGPT Plus: £20/month
- Claude Pro: £18/month
- Gemini Advanced: £19/month
- **Total**: £57/month for limited access

**Direct API Access:**
- Average professional use: £3-5/month
- Access to ALL models
- No limits or throttling
- **10x cost reduction**

### The Power Difference

## What Makes This Different

### Traditional AI Courses
- Theory-heavy explanations
- Focus on prompting techniques
- Limited to one platform
- Consumer-level access

### Our Approach
- Hands-on from minute one
- Multiple AI models compared
- Professional integration
- Enterprise-level control

## Prerequisites Check

Before we begin, ensure you have:
- [x] VS Code running from Module 05
- [x] Continue extension installed
- [x] Internet connection
- [x] Excitement for AI superpowers
- [x] A real project to enhance

## Common Concerns Addressed

### "I'm not technical enough"
If you can create an email account, you can get an API key. We'll walk through every click.

### "What about security?"
API keys are like passwords—keep them safe, and you're secure. We'll cover best practices.

### "Will I break something?"
No! APIs have limits and safeguards. You can't accidentally spend £1000 or break the internet.

### "Is this legal for my work?"
Yes! You're using the same models, just more efficiently. Check your organisation's AI policy as usual.
