# Chapter 4: Practical Codex: Real-World Examples and Walkthroughs

To solidify understanding and demonstrate the capabilities of OpenAI Codex, this chapter provides illustrative examples and conceptual walkthroughs for beginner, intermediate, and advanced tasks. These examples are based on documented use cases and features of the Codex cloud agent and CLI, as well as insights from the workshop discussions.

The workshop highlighted the "aha!" moment many experience:
> "it was actually wild i was I was talking to uh David K um a designer who was working on this thing called scientist and um he showed me this demo of it updating itself and like nowadays like I don't know if anyone of us would be like the most impressed to like change the background color modifying its own code yeah and then you know it was like they had hot reloading setup so I was just like mind blown at the time" - Alexander, OpenAI

This chapter aims to provide similar moments of clarity by showcasing practical applications.

We will explore:

*   [Beginner Tasks](./04_a_beginner_tasks.md): Quick fixes, code explanation, and boilerplate generation.
*   [Intermediate Tasks](./04_b_intermediate_tasks.md): Bug fixing with stack traces, component refactoring, and adding unit tests.
*   [Advanced Scenarios](./04_c_advanced_scenarios.md): Project scaffolding, pull request reviews, security audits, code transpilation, and generating SQL migrations.

These examples will illustrate the progression from simple commands to more complex, multi-step interactions, highlighting how developers can grow from novice users to practitioners by mastering Codex's diverse capabilities.
