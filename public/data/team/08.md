## Full Details

Full-time artist, working at the intersection of technological innovation and post-anthropological ethics. Interested in designing, consulting, and creating immersive and innovative new-media installations for gallery and public spaces. 

I believe in individual and institutional honesty, and I believe that an honest and routine appraisal of one’s planet-friendly credentials is an integral part of any fully honest person and of any fully honest institution. 

Before retiring from my first career to become a full-time artist, my background was in sound engineering and design, lighting design, production management and design, and virtual production, with over a decade spent designing, drafting, and delivering events of all kinds and sizes. 

Throughout my career I’ve kept up side projects across digital arts, and have studied mathematics, linguistics, literature, and sound design with several universities. I’m okay at C++, good at Python, and experienced in 3D graphics and AI workflows. I also research ethics, ecological safety and tech innovation, and have teaching experience across many age groups and sectors of society. 

People over profit and planet over people.
