- # Multi-Viewpoint Immersive AI Research Platform
	- ## Core Innovation
		- World-first: Multiple specialists collaborate in a single immersive space, each with their own stereoscopic viewpoint.
		- AI assisted Telepresent brings remote collaborators truly into the space with full body and audio
		- ![Narrative Fusion](../assets/image_(6)_1753016838104_5.png)
		- Real-time AI observes all communication channels (verbal, spatial, visual, gestural, conceptual, temporal).
		- Wave Field Synthesis spatial audio and volumetric telepresence enable natural, trust-based interaction.

	- ## The Flow State Advantage
		- Each expert sees only their relevant data—no overload, no context switching.
		- Natural spatial interaction and communication are preserved.
		- Professionals reach peak performance rapidly; AI learns from the best, not the confused.

	- ## How AI Learns from Experts
		- AI captures what each expert sees, says, and does—building a complete, multi-viewpoint picture.
		- Observes how shared understanding and new concepts emerge, not just translating between domains.
		- Builds a living ontology: a knowledge graph richer than any single perspective.

	- ## Real-World Impact
		- Example: Nuclear decommissioning planning reduced from 8 hours (traditional) to 2 hours (our approach), with better outcomes and less fatigue.

		- AI learns and propagates emergent protocols (e.g., 3D gesture language, risk communication systems) across teams and domains.

	- ## Research Programme & Outcomes
		- Years 1-2: Study team ontology emergence, map collaborative protocols, build AI observation.
		- Years 3-4: AI mediates, tests interventions, expands to larger teams.
		- Year 5+: Export to new domains, set standards, commercialise.
		- Outcomes: 10x faster planning, 90% fewer translation errors, 50% less training time, £1bn+ savings, improved safety.
	- ## Why the UK Must Lead
		- Unique convergence of technical, human, and research excellence.
		- Addresses £100bn nuclear challenge, complex legacy systems, and critical infrastructure.
		- Leverages UK’s collaborative culture and world-class AI/human factors research.
		- This facility will transform expert teamwork, create adaptive AI, and make the UK a global leader in collaborative intelligence.
			- **The technology is ready. The need is critical. The potential is transformative.**
