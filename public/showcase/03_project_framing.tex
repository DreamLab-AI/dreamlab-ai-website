\section{Project Framing and Strategic Context}

\subsection{Executive Overview}

This project aims to establish a \textbf{world-class immersive visualisation facility} – a next-generation CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) that will serve as a national academic platform for research in automation, robotics, risk management, nuclear engineering, advanced manufacturing, and beyond. The system will enable teams of researchers (up to 6 simultaneously) to step inside shared, life-size 3D simulations without wearing VR headsets, fostering unprecedented collaborative research capabilities.
