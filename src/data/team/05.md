Jing Li - Creative AI Eurasia Pacific

## Full Details

Creative AI Technologist | Innovator | Advocate for AI Equity
Jing Li is a Creative AI Technologist with a unique background that bridges business, technology, and community-driven innovation. After more than a decade in the fashion industry, where she led design, manufacturing, and sustainable sourcing, Jing made a bold career change into data science and artificial intelligence during her maternity break. Since then, she has been dedicated to making emerging technologies more accessible and meaningful for everyone.
Over the past year, Jing has worked at the MediaCity Immersive Technology Innovation Hub (MITIH) and Dreamlab, supporting SMEs and creatives to experiment with cutting-edge tools including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), AI agents, creative AI (text-to-image/video), and multi-agent chatbot systems. She has collaborated on research with academic partners and industry leaders contributing to technical blueprints and user-centred prototyping.
Jing is passionate about responsible innovation, AI equity, and using technology to tackle real-world challenges — from sustainability and mental health to local economic development. She has led impact-focused data projects, such as evaluating wellbeing programs for perinatal mums through survey design, analysis, and data visualisation.
As a former business owner who once ran a sustainable clothing wholesale brand using deadstock and recycled fabrics, she understands the practical challenges faced by SMEs. She brings this perspective into her AI work by helping businesses innovate in resourceful, sustainable ways.
Currently part of a 25-person technologist collective at Dreamlab, Jing is co-developing hands-on workshops, podcasts, and digital content aimed at demystifying AI for general audiences. Her goal is to empower more people — especially those outside of tech — to explore, question, and create with AI.
